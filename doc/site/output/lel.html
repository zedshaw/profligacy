          <h2>Layout Expression Language</h2>


	<p>Profligacy lets you build any Swing <span class="caps">GUI</span> you&#8217;d like using the standard
containers and layout mechanisms.  However, most of those are difficult
to code and truly only exist to support companies who sell tools.</p>


	<p>In order to break programmer&#8217;s dependence on the <span class="caps">IDE</span> opiate, Profligacy
includes a unique layout method called <em>Layout Expression Language</em> or
just <span class="caps">LEL</span>.  It&#8217;s similar to a regex for layout that looks and works like
tables do in a Wiki.  Using a very simple small little syntax for how
cells in a component are organized, the programmer can develop the
interface without special tools.</p>


	<h3>Wiki Like Regex</h3>


	<p>If you&#8217;ve ever used <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth/">RedCloth</a>
to do tables you&#8217;ll probably know what I mean right away.  Most wiki
systems (like RedCloth) have a table layout that looks like this:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
 |apples|oranges|pears|
 |100   |50     |30   |
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>You&#8217;ll get different formatting options and appearance depending on how
advanced the tables can be.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">LEL</span> is very similar, but it works to organize and <strong>name</strong> the <em>cells</em>
that make up the places components should fill.  Here&#8217;s an example 
expression that&#8217;s laid out similar to a wiki table:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
 [ label_1        | label3           ]
 [ (300,300)*text1| (150)people      ]
 [ &lt;label2        | _                ]
 [ message        | buttons          ]
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>Right away you can see:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>This is a grid of 4 rows by 2 columns.</li>
		<li>Some of the cells have names in them like &#8220;label_1&#8221;, &#8220;people&#8221;.</li>
		<li>Before some names there&#8217;s modifiers.
	<ul>
	<li>(150) sets <em>people</em> to be 150 pixels wide.</li>
		<li>(300,300) sets <em>text1</em> to be 300 by 300 pixels in size.</li>
		<li>&#8216;&lt;&#8217; and &#8216;&gt;&#8217; align the cell left or right.</li>
		<li>&#8216;<code>*</code>&#8217; tells that cell to expand taking all available space.</li>
		<li>&#8217;^&#8217; and &#8217;.&#8217; make that component align top or bottom.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
		<li>One of the cells has just a &#8217;_&#8217; for the name.  This makes it empty.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Once you have a layout like this (and this chunk of code would actually
work) you&#8217;d then fill in all the cells with their components.  Since
the LELParser knows where everything already is, you can load these
components in any order that makes sense.  No more struggling to 
force things into a certain ordering just to keep a layout manager
happy.  Nice and flat.</p>


	<p>How all this is done depends on a little bit of theory.</p>


	<h3>Theory Behind <span class="caps">LEL</span></h3>


	<p>You really don&#8217;t need to know this to use <span class="caps">LEL</span>, but it helps to
understand what&#8217;s going on and why it works.  In fact, I&#8217;m kind of
amazed it actually works myself.  Just shows you what picking a good
algorithm can do.</p>


	<p>The basis of <span class="caps">LEL</span> is constraint programming.  All layout managers
are simply trying to balance a large constraint solving problem
that determines the size of cells in a grid.  It&#8217;s a solved problem,
and there&#8217;s libraries to do it, but these libraries are usually
more difficult to use than the already difficult layout managers.</p>


	<p>When you look at a constraint matrix, it actually looks like a 
table that gets built when you compile a regular expression or a
parser grammar.  It&#8217;s a big matrix with a series of constraints and
transitions in it (roughly, shut up, I know this).</p>


	<p>If a regex like <code>/^[0-9]([a-zA-Z_]*)$/</code> can be compiled into a
table of state transitions, why can&#8217;t a similar language be developed
for constraint solving problems?</p>


	<p>However, trying to do a layout with something like the above regex would
be very painful.  I&#8217;m sure it would attract super smart people, but there&#8217;s
not too many of those.  The next best language for composing a table
that&#8217;s visual is (you guessed it) the syntax that wiki sites use.</p>


	<p>With just a few simple tweaks to the syntax, a parser that can process
the syntax to configure a <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/GroupLayout.html">Swing GroupLayout</a>
and a way to plug the components into the grid, we have a fully functioning
layout language.</p>


	<p>Simple!  Ok, maybe not but like you need to really know this.  Take a
look at the code though to the parser, it&#8217;s pretty simple:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
col = "|";
ltab = "[";
rtab = "]";
valign = ("^" | ".");
expand = "*";
halign = ("&lt;" | "&gt;");
number =  digit+;
setw = ("(" number ("," number)? ")") ;
modifiers = (expand | valign | halign | setw);
id = modifiers* ((alpha | '_')+ :&gt;&gt; (alnum | '_')*);
row = space* ltab space* id space* (col space* id)* space* rtab space*;
main := row+;
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>Seriously, that&#8217;s the whole grammar for <span class="caps">LEL</span> from the LELParser.rl <a href="http://www.cs.queensu.ca/~thurston/ragel/">Ragel</a>
file.  I removed the actions so you could check it out, but otherwise
that&#8217;s it.</p>


	<h2>Advantages</h2>


	<p>The way that <span class="caps">LEL</span> is used in Profligacy is very unobtrusive.  If you don&#8217;t
want to use it then just don&#8217;t.  You can still configure all your original
Swing layout managers, and you&#8217;re <strong>supposed</strong> to use them where <span class="caps">LEL</span> won&#8217;t
work.  (NOTE: In the future <span class="caps">LEL</span> may just configure a few more than 
GroupLayout for consistency).</p>


	<p>The advantages to using <span class="caps">LEL</span> however are:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Structure and organization of the layout is decoupled from the construction
of the components in the layout.
	<ul>
	<li>This flattens the building process making it easier to follow and cleaner.</li>
		<li>You can build the components in the order that&#8217;s easiest, rather than what the layout dictates.</li>
		<li>Your layout structure can be changed easily without rewiring the components.  Just keep the names the same and you&#8217;re good.</li>
		<li>You can swap in different layouts easily depending on platforms.  This means you use the same components and building, but change a string to conform on <span class="caps">OSX</span> vs. Windows.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
		<li>Components get names tied to cells so it&#8217;s easier to see what is where.
	<ul>
	<li>This makes debugging very easy.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
		<li>One line of readable text can do an amazing amount of work without sacrificing clarity.</li>
		<li>The <strong>user</strong> can enter in a layout or choose from alternatives.  Just load and reparse, the actual code doing the build doesn&#8217;t change.</li>
		<li>LELParser tells you when you&#8217;ve got it wrong.  Since it&#8217;s a <span class="caps">DSL</span> for the layout, it tells you when you screwed up the layout.</li>
		<li>Many errors are caught that you might miss in other systems, like trying to use a cell that&#8217;s not been named, not naming a cell, etc.</li>
		<li>It&#8217;s easy to tweak and mess with the <span class="caps">GUI</span> layout since you just change the layout expression and not tons of building code.</li>
		<li>The interactions are also separated from the building and layout, so you have another separation of concerns.</li>
		<li>Even if those symbols freak you out, compared to <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/tpavek/archive/2006/03/getting_to_know.html">this crap</a> it&#8217;s a damn dream.</li>
		<li>No dependence on tools and you can read the damn code you write.</li>
		<li>You can extend the LELParser engine to support other layouts, not just GroupLayout.  Just write a Ruby listener that does the work and you&#8217;re good.</li>
		<li>It looks like Ruby.  Very <strong>nice</strong> Ruby.</li>
		<li>It&#8217;s never in your way, so you can always get to the underlying Swing to do what you need.</li>
		<li>Most importantly: <strong>You don&#8217;t have to use it!</strong></li>
	</ul>


	<p>With all these advantages people will still not want to use <span class="caps">LEL</span>, so just
take a look at the other <a href="samples.html">samples</a> to see how you don&#8217;t need
to use it.</p>


	<h2>Demo: Chat Layout</h2>


	<p>Remember that little sample I gave previously:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
 [ label_1        | label3           ]
 [ (300,300)*text1| (150)people      ]
 [ &lt;label2        | _                ]
 [ message        | buttons          ]
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>Well, that is actually from one of the examples that builds a little
chat user interface.  The interface doesn&#8217;t actually do anything, but it
does show how you can easily make a nice <span class="caps">GUI</span>.</p>


	<p>Let&#8217;s build it so it looks like this:</p>


	<p><img src="/profligacy/images/sample_lel_gui_nested.png" alt="" /></p>


	<h3>First Let&#8217;s Make This Unclear</h3>


	<p>The above <span class="caps">LEL</span> expression doesn&#8217;t have to be laid out this way.  We could
also just do this:</p>


<pre>
  "[label_1|label3][(300,300)*text1|(150)people][&lt;label2|_][message|buttons]" 
</pre>

	<p>That&#8217;s the exact same thing we just compressed it down by removing all the
spacing.  Depending on the size and complexity of the layout, this might be
preferred.  In the demo we&#8217;re just going to keep it in the nice formatting
so you can see what&#8217;s going on, but just like a regex you should get to
where you can read it if you use <span class="caps">LEL</span> a lot.</p>


	<p>One thing people don&#8217;t quite understand is that, once you have a language
that&#8217;s succinct for doing your layouts you don&#8217;t really need to write that
much of it.  In my tests the <span class="caps">LEL</span> doesn&#8217;t get <strong>much</strong> more complex than what
you&#8217;re reading above.  Spacing it out clearly helps, but sometimes that&#8217;s
also more confusing than just putting it in one line.</p>


	<h3>And Into Ruby</h3>


	<p>Alright, now we&#8217;ll need to put this into some Ruby to get it all to work.
First here&#8217;s our system without the components:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
require 'profligacy/swing'
require 'profligacy/lel'

module Test
  include_package 'javax.swing'
  include Profligacy

  layout = " 
     [ label_1         | label3      ]
     [ (300,300)*text1 | (150)people ]
     [ &lt;label2         | _           ]
     [ message         | buttons     ]
  " 

  ui = Swing::LEL.new(JFrame,layout) do |c,i|
    # nothing here for now
  end

  ui.build(:args =&gt; "Simple LEL Example")
end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>We just require the profligacy swing and lel libraries, then make a module
to test things out.  We need a module because JRuby is really picky about
how Java stuff is included.</p>


	<p>Once we have that we simply make a <a href="/profligacy/rdoc/classes/Profligacy/Swing/LEL.html">Swing::LEL</a> builder rather than say a 
<a href="/profligacy/rdoc/classes/Profligacy/Swing/Build.html">Swing::Build</a> regular
builder.</p>


	<p>The <em>Swing::LEL</em> builder is passed the JFrame component just like with Swing::Build, but instead of a list of child components, it&#8217;s given a full on <span class="caps">LEL</span>.
The Swing::LEL builder will infer the names of the components <strong>and</strong> the
layout to use from this one expression.</p>


	<h3>Now The Guts</h3>


	<p>Now we add the components we want, but we&#8217;ll skip the <em>buttons</em> cell
for now and just set it to a JPanel:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
require 'profligacy/swing'
require 'profligacy/lel'

module Test
  include_package 'javax.swing'
  include Profligacy

  layout = " 
     [ label_1         | label3      ]
     [ (300,300)*text1 | (150)people ]
     [ &lt;label2         | _           ]
     [ message         | buttons     ]
  " 

  ui = Swing::LEL.new(JFrame,layout) do |c,i|
    c.label_1 = JLabel.new "The chat:" 
    c.label2  = JLabel.new "What you're saying:" 
    c.label3  = JLabel.new "The people:" 
    c.text1   = JTextArea.new
    c.people  = JComboBox.new
    c.message = JTextArea.new 

    # we'll replace this later with a subcomponent 
    c.buttons = JPanel.new
  end

  ui.build(:args =&gt; "Simple LEL Example")
end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>Like magic this should just run, minus the buttons on the right and it
might be a little wonky looking.  Otherwise, that is seriously all you need
to do most component layouts.</p>


	<p>Two things to notice, in the block you get a <code>do |c,i|</code> but we only use
the <em>c</em> variable.  This is where you set the components and it&#8217;s a
Ruby Struct that&#8217;s loaded with attributes based on the names in the 
<span class="caps">LEL</span> expression.  That&#8217;s how it keeps you straight, so if you tried to
do <code>c.screwup = JButton.new "noway"</code> JRuby would explode saying that
the <em>screwup</em> variable isn&#8217;t in that struct.</p>


	<p>The <em>i</em> variable is just for interactions.  It&#8217;s also a struct and you
just attach a set of hashes that point at what <em>proc</em> or <em>method</em> should
be called when that component goes off.  For example, you could do:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
i.message = {:changed =&gt; proc {|t,e| puts "type: #{t}, event: #{e}" } }
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>This would attach a ChangeListener that when the <em>message</em> JTextField
changed it would print out what type of event and the Event object.
You could also do it with:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
i.message = {:changed =&gt; method(:message_changed)}

def message_changed(type, event)
  # do stuff
end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>This will have the <em>changed</em> event call <em>message_changed</em> on your class,
and since it works with <strong>any</strong> ruby method using <em>method.to_proc</em> you can
also point it at methods on other objects not just self.</p>


	<p>Finally, you just call <em>build</em> with various options (see the <a href="/rdoc/">RDoc</a>)
but most importantly, you have to pass <code>:args =&gt; "Simple LEL Example"</code>
so that the JFrame gets a name.</p>


	<h3>Now Those Buttons</h3>


	<p>That&#8217;s your first functional <span class="caps">GUI</span>, but we need to add that <em>buttons</em>
panel to this.  This will actually be where we nest another layout
inside this one, and with our fancy JRuby code it&#8217;s cake (a lot easier
than trying to nest a GroupLayout):</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
require 'profligacy/swing'
require 'profligacy/lel'

module Test
  include_package 'javax.swing'
  include Profligacy

  layout = " 
     [ label_1         | label3      ]
     [ (300,300)*text1 | (150)people ]
     [ &lt;label2         | _           ]
     [ message         | buttons     ]
  " 

  ui = Swing::LEL.new(JFrame,layout) do |c,i|
    c.label_1 = JLabel.new "The chat:" 
    c.label2  = JLabel.new "What you're saying:" 
    c.label3  = JLabel.new "The people:" 
    c.text1   = JTextArea.new
    c.people  = JComboBox.new
    c.message = JTextArea.new 

    c.buttons = Swing::LEL.new(JPanel, "[send|hate|quit]") do |c,i|
      c.send    = JButton.new "Send" 
      c.hate    = JButton.new "Hate" 
      c.quit    = JButton.new "Quit" 
    end.build :auto_create_container_gaps =&gt; false
  end

  ui.build(:args =&gt; "Simple LEL Example")
end
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>See where we just change <em>buttons</em> from a single JPanel to a JPanel
with it&#8217;s own GroupLayout, <span class="caps">LEL</span> expression, and set of components?
The only piece of code that might freak you out is:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
    ...
      c.quit    = JButton.new "Quit" 
    end.build :auto_create_container_gaps =&gt; false
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>Ruby is an <em>expression</em> base language, that means everything you write,
even control structures like a do/end block, has a value you can
modify.  In this case, the result of doing a <code>Swing::LEL.new</code> is the
<span class="caps">LEL</span> object instance, but what we want to attach to <em>c.buttons</em> is
the JFrame. That JFrame comes from the call to build, so just put 
build on the <em>end</em> and presto!  The build call result is assigned
to <em>c.buttons</em>.</p>


	<p>Ok, fine, it&#8217;s like doing this:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
    ...
    lel = Swing::LEL.new(JPanel, "[send|hate|quit]") do |c,i|
      c.send    = JButton.new "Send" 
      c.hate    = JButton.new "Hate" 
      c.quit    = JButton.new "Quit" 
    end

    c.buttons = lel.build :auto_create_container_gaps =&gt; false
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>However that&#8217;s ugly.  Try to understand the original because it&#8217;s
a great trick.</p>


	<h2>Running The Sample</h2>


	<p>Depending on how you installed Profligacy you may need to run this example
in different ways.  The best way is to have installed Profligacy via
RubyGems and then simply run jruby so that it loads rubygems:</p>


	<pre><code>$ JRUBY_HOME/bin/gem install profligacy
$ jruby -rrubygems layout_test.rb</code></pre>


	<p>You can run all the samples this way (and you only have to install once).</p>


	<h2>Conclusion</h2>


	<p>Using <span class="caps">LEL</span> is still experimental, so as the Utu iHate client continues
I&#8217;ll be refining it and improving it.  However, right now it&#8217;s pretty
powerful and the whole Profligacy system has made many examples in
several Swing books trivial to implement.</p>
