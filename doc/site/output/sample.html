          <h2>How&#8217;s it used?</h2>


	<p>Profligacy is really easy to use, but you should still be referring
to the Swing&#8482; docs to learn how to actually use the components.</p>


	<p>These examples are all in the project&#8217;s examples directory along with
many others.</p>


	<p>You should also check out the <a href="lel.html"><span class="caps">LEL</span> instructions</a> for a
fully explained example using the <em>Layout Expression Language</em>.</p>


	<h2>The Book</h2>


	<p>These examples are translated from the book <em>Swing: A Beginner&#8217;s Guide</em> 
by Herbert Schildt and published by McGraw Hill.</p>


	<p>What I did was translate the Java code examples to Profligacy and then
cleaned them up so they are Ruby idiomatic.  The new work is completely
different looking compared to what&#8217;s in the book.</p>


	<h2>examples/swing1.rb</h2>


	<p>This example doesn&#8217;t really show off Profligacy but instead shows you
what the raw Swing looks like with JRuby.  As you can see it&#8217;s much
nicer than doing it in Java already.</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
require 'java'
require 'profligacy/swing'

import 'javax.swing.JFrame'
import 'javax.swing.JLabel'

class SwingDemo
  def initialize
    jfrm = JFrame.new "A Simple Demo" 
    jfrm.setSize(275,100)
    jfrm.default_close_operation = JFrame::EXIT_ON_CLOSE
    jlab = JLabel.new " Swing powers the modern Java GUI" 
    jfrm.add jlab
    jfrm.pack
    jfrm.visible = true
  end
end

SwingUtilities.invoke_later proc { SwingDemo.new }.to_runnable
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<h2>examples/swing2.rb</h2>


	<p>This is the first example that uses Profligacy to build the Swing
<span class="caps">GUI</span>, but which doesn&#8217;t use <a href="lel.html"><span class="caps">LEL</span></a> to do the layout.  Instead
it just uses a plain <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/FlowLayout.html">FlowLayout</a>
to organize the components.</p>

	<p>Notice also that you can use the <em>to_runnable</em> and the regular Ruby
procs to do all your callbacks.  This removes a <strong>huge</strong> amount of repetitive
error prone Java code from doing listeners and runnables.</p>


	<h2>examples/swing3.rb</h2>


	<p>This example is a simple stop watch that shows how the callbacks
can also be <code>method(:name)</code> callbacks.  What Profligacy does is anything
that&#8217;s registered as a callback has <em>to_proc</em> called on it.  This means
if you pass in a proc, that gets called.  If you pass in a method, it
gets converted to a proc.</p>


	<p>This means that you can implement callbacks on other objects by simply
getting their method.  The signature for the method should be <code>method(type,event)</code> with type being a symbol for the Java method that was called, and
event being the <span class="caps">AWT</span> Event object.</p>


	<p><img src="images/swing3_screen.png" alt="" /></p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
require 'profligacy/swing'

class StopWatch
  include_package 'javax.swing'
  import 'java.awt.FlowLayout'
  include Profligacy

  def initialize
    @ui = Swing::Build.new JFrame, :start, :stop, :lab do |c,i|
      c.start = JButton.new "Start" 
      c.stop = JButton.new "Stop" 
      c.lab = JLabel.new "Press Start to begin timing." 

      i.start = { :action =&gt; method(:start) }
      i.stop = { :action =&gt; method(:stop) }
    end

    @ui.layout = FlowLayout.new
    @ui.build("Stop Watch").default_close_operation = JFrame::EXIT_ON_CLOSE
  end

  def start(type, event)
    @ui.lab.text = "Stopwatch is running..." 
    @time = Time.new
  end

  def stop(type, event)
    if @time
      @ui.lab.text = "#{Time.now.to_i - @time.to_i} seconds." 
    else
      @ui.lab.text = "Start the watch first." 
    end
    @time = nil
  end
end

SwingUtilities.invoke_later proc { StopWatch.new }.to_runnable

</blockquote>

	<p>The signature for methods has to be <code>callback(type, event)</code> and the
type is a symbol that represents the method name Java tried to call.
This lets you tailor the reactions based on the type without having
to dig into the event.  It&#8217;s also necessary because the name and types
of the events are inconsistent from the method that&#8217;s called in Swing.</p>


	<h2>examples/swing4.rb</h2>


	<p>This example shows the real power of Ruby over Java.  It&#8217;s dynamic 
nature means you can crank out tons of <strong>readable</strong> functionality with
very little code.  The Java version of this simply repeated
calls to <code>new JLabel("Left, Top")</code> and then use the exact same names
as constants to set that alignment.</p>


	<p>In the Ruby example below, I use an array of symbols and then just
simply construct both the label and the alignment from them.</p>

	<p>This sample also shows you how, because Profligacy uses <em>yield</em> rather
than <em>instance_eval</em> to have you build the components you can use
the full power of Ruby to help build things.  No need to worry about
how the contents of this block is interpreted because it&#8217;s not.</p>


	<h2>examples/swing5.rb</h2>


	<p>This sample shows how you can access the components in the returned
<em>Swing::Build</em> object in your callbacks.  In this example we&#8217;ve
saved a <em>@ui</em> object and then we simply reference the components by
their names in the <em>toggled</em> callback.  This helps organize and
structure the code.  Rather than flood the class with a mixture of
UI component variables and variables that actually are needed for
the UI&#8217;s logic, we just have them in a handy single location with
consistent names.</p>

	<p>You of course don&#8217;t <strong>have</strong> to do this at all, it&#8217;s just proven to 
reduce code repetition since you already named these variables in
another place, used them there, and will need them again later.</p>


	<p>No point then storing these components in variables again.</p>


	<h2>examples/swing6.rb</h2>


	<p>This sample simply shows handling various events from components.
One thing that hasn&#8217;t been discussed is how you register a callback.
The two variables passed to your block are the <em>components</em> and 
<em>interactions</em> (here done as <em>c,i</em>).  You put components on
the c variable and they get loaded into the layout and <em>JFrame</em>
(or <em>JPanel</em> or any container) when you call <em>build</em>.</p>


	<p>The interactions are just your proc or method that you attach to the
<em>i</em> variable.  The problem is many components have different callbacks
that fire off.  Some answer <em>actionListener</em> others answer <em>changedListener</em>.
The solution is you attach a Ruby <em>Hash</em> that maps the <em>action</em> to the
callback to make.  You do as many as you want to handle, and when
<em>build</em> is called they get appropriately translated.</p>

	<p>The way you figure out the symbol to use is from the Swing documentation.
Swing uses a method signature of addSomethingListener.  For :action 
it&#8217;s <em>addActionListener</em>.  All you do is drop the <em>add</em> and <em>Listener</em>
and what&#8217;s in the middle is what you set in the Hash. For example, if
you had a component with an <em>addJavaIsRetardedListener</em> you&#8217;d use the
symbol <em>javaIsRetarded</em> to set the callback.</p>


	<h3>Using Arrays Of Components</h3>


	<p>You should also notice another handy feature of Profligacy shown in
demo swing6.rb.  Notice this code:</p>


<blockquote>
<pre>
      ...
      c.texts = [ JTextField.new(10), JTextField.new(10)]
      c.texts.each_with_index {|t,n| t.action_command = "text#{n}" }
      ...
</pre>
</blockquote>

	<p>When you set a component to an Array Profligacy assumes you want them
to be added in order and to have the same callback applied to them all.</p>


	<p>This cuts down on having to use tons of names in the builder for what&#8217;s
effectively the same component repeated.  The alternative would be to have
a <em>c.text1</em>, <em>c.text2</em>, etc.  It also saves you time since Profligacy
will take the <code>i.texts = {:action =&gt; method(:text_action)}</code> and apply
that <strong>same</strong> callback to <strong>all</strong> the components in that Array.</p>


	<h2>examples/swing7.rb</h2>


	<p>This sample shows more advanced callback handling and again shows
how Ruby cleans up the code tremendously.  The Java version had
repetitive if/else blocks and nasty String construction to do the
same thing.  In Ruby we just use <em>each</em> and build the string
we want on the fly.</p>

	<p>This is probably the most complex demo since it actually works as
a phone book (although a really small one).  No, that&#8217;s not my
real number.</p>


	<p>Again this shows how Ruby just destroys the complexity in these
GUIs.  By using a <em>case/when</em> block and built-in regex usage we
can just do the lookup in about 4 lines of code.</p>

	<h2>examples/swing8_lel.rb</h2>


	<p>The last sample is the first demonstration of using <span class="caps">LEL</span>, but also an
example of when you might not what to use <em>Swing::LEL</em> compared to
<em>Swing::Build</em>.  In this case, the code is almost the same and the
results are nearly the same.</p>


	<p><img src="images/swing8_lel_screen.png" alt="" /></p>


	<p>What you can see is that the layout has a bit more <em>flavor</em> to it, with
components right justified, filled out, and better spacing.  This is
the primary advantage of <span class="caps">LEL</span> in this situation.  It allows you to tweak
and make the layout look nicer.  It&#8217;s also better when the layout gets
more complex.</p>


	<p>However, don&#8217;t bother using <span class="caps">LEL</span> when a simple FlowLayout might work
instead.  Use the right tool for the job.  See the <a href="lel.html"><span class="caps">LEL</span> instructions</a>

	<p>This one is very configurable, and if you want to try it you have to do the following:</p>


	<ol>
	<li>Grab the substance.jar.</li>
		<li>export <span class="caps">CLASSPATH</span>=.:substance.jar</li>
		<li>jruby -J-Dswing.defaultlaf=org.jvnet.substance.SubstanceLookAndFeel -Ilib examples/utu_main.rb</li>
	</ol>


	<p>The utu_main.rb file is now included in the examples directory of the profligacy.gem.</p>


	<p>So, quit your whining, you can make it look however you want.</p>
